    <p>In the audio I try to briefly explain what robotics at my high school is like and why I enjoy it.</p>

    <p>Hi, I'm going to talk about robotics because I like it. We participate in a high school competition called the FIRST Tech Challenge. Basically, every year they release an objective for us to complete. It usually involves some kind of prop and a unique way to move it, and it's different every year. Like last year, we had to take little rectangular prisms or whatever, boxes. We had to take boxes out of a cage in the center of the field and place them in a basket, like an elevated basket. That's an example of a challenge. Then this year it's like balls that we have to shoot them into a thing, whatever. Yeah, but we have to do stuff. Basically, there's an autonomous section, which is it moves on its own. Then it goes to a driving section, which is like we pick up controllers and we know how to drive them. That's all the premise you need.</p>
    
    <p>I really like robotics. My first year in robotics, I mostly helped with building. I've been helping with building all of it, basically the whole time I've been there. It's a pretty big club. I'm not doing all of it, obviously, but I like helping with building and I like talking to people in the club. My second year there, I tried to help with coding a little more. I was getting into that. That was when I was learning Java. Really in the 11th grade last year.</p>
  
    <p>We do really well. I usually meet twice a week, but coming up on competitions, everyone who's more dedicated members, we usually end up having to stay on Thursdays or Fridays until 6 p.m. at the school, trying to finish as much of the robot as we can, but it pays off. We do good in competitions. We've gone to state two years in a row. I'm really proud of that. State is fun. Getting on the bus with everyone is fun, eventually, and seeing all the schools is fun. Robotics is fun. I like doing that.</p>

    <p>Really, I like the iteration and engineering part. That's why you do robotics, obviously. I like working with other people who like engineering and doing stuff like that. I think it's a really cool environment and I'm glad I'm doing it.</p>

    <h2>Summary of my thoughts</h2>
    <p>Essentially, robotics has been a big part of my experience in highschool and I've made most of my close friends through it. In college, I hope to go into computer engineering, partly inspired by being in robotics. I want to continue to be surrounded by like-minded engineers who share the same passion I do.</p>
