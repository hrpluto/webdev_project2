    <h1>My Home Page</h1>

    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>Hi, welcome to my home page. I'm gonna talk about a few hobbies I have briefly. On this page I'll go over my history with music and some information about my high school's esports team.</p>

    <h2>I Like Playing Music</h2>
    <p>I've been playing the piano since I was 6 years old and I still do now. This doesn't really mean I'm some sort of prodigy but I'm good enough to play songs that make me happy. I still practice a little every week have been trying to learn some fun songs like "Claire-De-Lune" and "Linus and Lucy." Although, mainly, I enjoy playing music with other people. Every once in a while my friend will invite me to play piano/keyboard at a block party or a barbeque by his house and I we either practice a few songs before hand; or, I find chords online and try to learn some kind of arrangement on the spot.</p>
    
    <p>I also play the clarinet in my high school band. Clarinet is something I've been playing for less time. I joined my middle school band and started learning when I was 10 and I only really played during school. I like playing clarinet but its not as much fun to practice alone as it is to play in a larger group. Playing with other instruments creates a fuller sound that I find more enjoyment knowing I'm a part of, rather than improving at a solo piece at home. Playing the clarinet might just become a random talent I have in the future, unless I pursue something later in life that keeps me playing.</p>
  
    <h2>Esports</h2>
    <p>This year I joined my high school's esports team to play Super Smash Brothers Ultimate. This still feels a little embarssing to admit to people but I do actually have a lot of fun with the club and the embarssment is really just in my head so its okay. In the club, I attend monthly tournaments where we play a group format of cycling through players called a crew battle. The most recent event for the Illinois High School Esports Assosiation (IHSEA), was held at Leydon High school.</p>

    <p>If you look hard enough, the back of my head can be found in the back right of the picture. Anyway, this was the second event we attendended. The first event we managed to get 2nd place out of 9 other teams, but this most recent event we only placed 7th, going 1-2 in our bracket. The team plans to practice twice a week in preparation for our next event and I'm excited to see how the club goes over the course of the rest of the year.</p>
